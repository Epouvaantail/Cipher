                    In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, 
                    Caesar's code, or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. 
                    It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
                    For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. 
                    The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

                    The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text where each letter of the plaintext is encoded with a different Caesar cipher, 
                    whose increment is determined by the corresponding letter of another text, the key. For example, if the plaintext is attacking tonight and the key is OCULORHINOLARINGOLOGY, 
                    then the first letter a of the plaintext is shifted by 14 positions in the alphabet (because the first letter O of the key is the 14th letter of the alphabet, counting from 0), yielding o;
                    the second letter t is shifted by 2 (because the second letter C of the key means 2) yielding v;
                    the third letter t is shifted by 20 (U) yielding n, with wrap-around;
                    and so on; yielding the message ovnlqbpvt hznzouz. If the recipient of the message knows the key, they can recover the plaintext by reversing this process.
                    The Vigenère cipher is therefore a special case of a polyalphabetic substitution.
